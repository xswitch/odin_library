# TODO

> Remove expanding on click
> Add edit button, use much of the same logic as expand

> Enable editing of entries
>> Create edit button for every entry or just a general one that toggles editState like remove
>> when an entry is clicked, change all elements in it from <p> to inputs, and recreate elements with those values when editing is done


> Click > get all elements of clicked object > change to inputs with current text inside >
Click > create an object out of the input elements > send object through normal creating route
